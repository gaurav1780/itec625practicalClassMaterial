This weeks workshop is about understanding defining and calling methods.

## 1. Identify need for a method

Consider each of the following codes and identify if there is any need for a method?

(a)

```java
int a = 7, b = 9, c;
if(a > b) {
    c = 1;
}
else if(a < b){
    c = -1;
}
else {
    c = 0;
}
int p = 5, q = 4, r;
if(p > q) {
    r = 1;
}
else if(p < q){
    r = -1;
}
else {
    r = 0;
}
int x = 8, y = 8, z;
if(x > y) {
    z = 1;
}
else if(x < y){
    z = -1;
}
else {
    z = 0;
}
```
(b)

```java
int a = 57 , b = 10;
int remainder = a%b;
int n = a - remainder ;
if( remainder >= b /2) {
    n = n + b;
}
int p = 17 , q = 5;
remainder = p%q;
int r = p - remainder ;
if( remainder >= q /2) {
    r = r + q;
}
```
## 2. Designing functions 

Based on the lecture notes, draw a block diagram for methods,

* when passed a number, returns `true` if the integer is even, and `false` otherwise. What is the data type for the input(s)? What is the data type for the return value/ output?

* when passed two numbers, returns `true` if they both have the same last digit, and `false` otherwise. What is the data type for the input(s)? What is the data type for the return value/ output?

* when passed three boolean values, return the number of values that are `true`. What is the data type for the input(s)? What is the data type for the return value/ output?

## 3. Calling methods 

Consider each of the following methods and write down a method call with
actual parameters of your choice. You may assume that the calls are made from another method in the same class.

Make sure you store the value returned (if any) in a variable of the correct data type and state the value of that variable as a comment.

The first part is solved as an example.

(a)

```java
public static int nDigits (int n) {
    int result = 0;
    while(n !=0) {
        result ++;
        n=n /10;
    }
    return result ;
}
```
**SOLUTION** - Method call:

```java
int a = 452017;
int k = nDigits(a); //k will be 6
```
(b)

```java
public static boolean and (boolean a , boolean b) {
    if(a == false)
        return false;
    if(b == false)
        return false;
    return true;
}
```
(c)

```java
public static int roundOff (double a) {
    int b = (int)a;
    double decimal = a - b;
    if( decimal < 0.5)
        return b;
    else
        return b +1;
}
```
(d)

```java
public static double average (int a , int b) {
    return (a+b) /2.0; // not 2, but 2.0
}
```
## 4. Defining a method from scratch

Write down the definition for each of the methods for which you drew a block diagram in question 2.

## 5. Implementation given method headers.

Import the project from archive file `methodsWorkshopTemplate` and implement as many methods as you can. Tests are provided in class `AllInOneTest`.

We havenâ€™t provided a header for the method `sameOddity`. Read the specification and write down the method header and body. Then uncomment the corresponding test in class `AllInOneTest`.
